### Repo Notes
- All game systems are built in the `main/Source/SteamCompany` using C++ in a component based archtecture to maintain reuability of code without sticking to a rigid class structure.
- All visuals in the game such as UI, Particles, and Sounds are done through the blueprint system.
- Game builds are to large to be hosted on github, but you can build from source localy. The most recent stable game build can be found on the above itch.io page

## Game Elevator Pitch
